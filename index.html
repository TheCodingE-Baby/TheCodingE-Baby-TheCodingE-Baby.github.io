                        <p>
                            This car is very cost-effective.
                           You don't need worry for money when
                           a car like this occurs, since it is

                    <p>
                        Ahh, a classic! This car reminds the devolopers
                        of a neat lookin action figure from the 80s, where
                        the tough guy gets in his car and rides it till sunset.
                        This is like that car, only realistic and better.

                <p>
                    This car is very good under rugged terrain, since its all-wheel
                    drive feature allows it to perform such nasty, nasty stunts off-road.
                    it truly is a beast of its kind, equalling no other, and losing for nobody
                    else. Buy this car and you can discover the edges of the world.

                    This car may look small and compact, but don't be fooled;
                    it has a lot of power in it. Almost as small as a ton, this
                    car not only looks efficient, but <strong>IS</strong> efficient
                    in what it does best, speed and control.               </p>
